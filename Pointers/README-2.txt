In this text I will explain in detail how I setup my game and got “Hey,that’s my fish!” to run.
First I include different #includes as the program required more than one type.Then I started off with the skeleton code that was provided to us. Then I created a printgrid function to print the grid values and “P” or “A” in locations where the player and AI are and also “.” in places already visited.I then created a structure for the player and what this basically does is have pointers that keep track of the current position the player is in and the total points the player has.Then I created a playermovement function that basically implements the movement and the steps that the player has chosen.I have even setup restrictions for edge cases where there might be invalid moves.Then I created an AI structure which basically has the same function as the player structure. Like the player I also made an AI movement function that choses the largest value in all the direction and moves there,just as the rubric wanted it.It may look messy and not proper design but I found out this works the best and there was no other way I found to implement the AI smart but not too smart.Then comes the main function where I intialize and even call functions previously made.I also made a for loop to assign values in each memory location of the malloc.the I created for loops for different movement or commands the user gives as these are useful for functions declared above.I then created two while loops one to stop the game and another to display the outcome of the game.I have made this project without the use of array and stuck to the guide by using structure,pointers and various others as you could see. 


In this program I have used integers,characters,pointers,sturctures,for loops and if statements,printf and scanf functions,malloc and various others all falling in the guidelines.
